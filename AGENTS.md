## Architecture

### Core Domain Models

The application revolves around administrative procedures and their submissions:

**Procedure** - An administrative form template created by administrators
- State machine: `brouillon` (initial) → `publiee` → `close` or `depubliee`
  - `brouillon`: Draft procedure being edited
  - `publiee`: Published and accepting dossiers
  - `close`: Closed, no longer accepting new dossiers
  - `depubliee`: Unpublished (can be republished)
- Uses revision-based versioning via `ProcedureRevision`
- Has `draft_revision` and `published_revision` to support iterative changes
- Contains `TypeDeChamp` (field types) that define the form structure
- Organized using `GroupeInstructeur` for routing submitted dossiers

**Dossier** - A user's submission of a procedure (the filled form)
- State machine: `brouillon` → `en_construction` → `en_instruction` → `accepte`/`refuse`/`sans_suite`
- Contains `Champ` instances (the actual field values)
- Tracks state changes via `Traitement` records
- Extensively uses concerns: DossierCloneConcern, DossierRebaseConcern, DossierStateConcern, etc.
- Notification badges track `dossier_expirant` and `dossier_suppression` states

**TypeDeChamp & Champ Architecture** (critical and complex):

The form system is based on a sophisticated type/value pattern:

- **TypeDeChamp** defines the structure of a field in a procedure's revision
  - 40+ specialized types in `app/models/types_de_champ/` (e.g., `TypesDeChamp::TextTypeDeChamp`, `TypesDeChamp::PieceJustificativeTypeDeChamp`)
  - Stores configuration (label, description, mandatory, conditional logic, etc.)
  - Linked to specific `ProcedureRevision` via `RevisionTypeDeChamp` join table
  - Can have parent-child relationships for repetitions (repeating blocks of fields)
  - Position determines order in the form

- **Champ** stores the actual user-entered value for a TypeDeChamp in a dossier
  - 40+ corresponding types in `app/models/champs/` (e.g., `Champs::TextChamp`, `Champs::PieceJustificativeChamp`)
  - Polymorphic relationship: each Champ subclass handles its specific data type
  - Linked to both its `Dossier` and its `TypeDeChamp`
  - Values stored differently per type: `value` column for text, `data` or `value_json` JSONB for complex types, ActiveStorage attachments for files
  - Champs can be public (filled by user) or private (filled by instructeur)
  - Conditional visibility managed via `Condition` and logic system in `app/models/logic/`

- **Revision System** enables evolving forms without breaking existing dossiers
  - When a procedure is modified, a new revision is created
  - Dossiers track which revision they were created with
  - `DossierRebaseConcern` handles migrating dossiers to newer revisions
  - Each dossier can be rebased to use the latest published revision while preserving data

**User Roles:**
- **Usager** (User) - Fills out and submits dossiers
- **Administrateur** - Creates and manages procedures
- **Instructeur** - Reviews and processes dossiers; has filters and notifications to help with instruction
- **Expert** - Can be invited to review specific dossiers
- **Gestionnaire** - Manages groups of administrateurs (feature-flagged)
- **SuperAdmin** - Platform team managing the entire system

Note: A single user account can have multiple roles. Different security measures protect access based on user profiles and roles.

### Key Patterns

**Concerns** - Extensively used to organize model behavior
- Model concerns in `app/models/concerns/`
- Controller concerns in `app/controllers/concerns/`
- Prefer concerns over service objects for domain logic

**Services** - Located in `app/services/`, handle complex operations
- Examples: `DossierProjectionService`, `PiecesJustificativesService`, `ApiGeoService`
- LLM services in `app/services/llm/` for AI-powered form improvement (Simpliscore)
- Used for cross-cutting concerns and external API integrations
- Avoid dependency injection in constructors; mock directly in tests

**View Components** - ViewComponent library for reusable UI (not React components)
- Located in `app/components/`
- Examples: `EditableChamp`, `Dossiers::*Component`, `Instructeurs::*Component`

**Jobs** - Async processing with Sidekiq (migrating from delayed_job)
- Located in `app/jobs/`
- API Entreprise integrations in `app/jobs/api_entreprise/`
- CRON jobs in `app/jobs/cron/`
- LLM processing in `app/jobs/llm/`

**GraphQL API** - Public API for external access
- Schema in `app/graphql/`
- Mutations in `app/graphql/mutations/`
- Types in `app/graphql/types/`

### Frontend Architecture

**Multi-Framework Approach:**
- **Turbo/Hotwire** - Primary navigation and form handling
- **Stimulus** - JavaScript controllers in `app/javascript/controllers/`
- **React** - Complex interactive components in `app/javascript/components/`
- **Vite** - Build tool for JavaScript/CSS (replaces Webpacker)
- **DSFR** - French government design system (@gouvfr/dsfr)

**Template Languages:**
- `.html.erb` - Herb templates (preferred for new code; use bun lint:herb and bun format:herb)
- `.html.haml` - Haml templates (legacy, being phased out)

### Controllers Organization

Controllers are organized by user role:
- `app/controllers/users/` - End-user (dossier submitters)
- `app/controllers/instructeurs/` - Instructors reviewing dossiers
- `app/controllers/administrateurs/` - Procedure creators
- `app/controllers/manager/` - Super-admin (Administrate-based)
- `app/controllers/gestionnaires/` - Group managers (feature-flagged)

### External API Integrations

**Authentication:**
- **FranceConnect** - Citizen authentication via government identity provider
- **ProConnect** - Professional/agent authentication for government employees
- Both are critical for secure user authentication and are implemented in `app/controllers/france_connect_controller.rb` and `app/controllers/pro_connect_controller.rb`

**Government APIs:**
- `ApiEntrepriseService` - Company data (SIREN/SIRET)
- `ApiGeoService` - Geographic data (addresses, regions)
- `ApiParticulier` - Citizen data
- Various specialized services: `AnnuaireServicePublicService`, `ApiBretagne`

**LLM APIs:**
- OpenAI-compatible (Mistral, …) for AI-powered form improvements (Simpliscore feature)

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Standards

**Tests Required** - All PRs must include tests
- Model specs in `spec/models/`
- Controller specs in `spec/controllers/`
- System specs in `spec/system/`
- Component specs in `spec/components/`

**Commit Standards:**
- Commit messages in English
- Small, atomic commits
- Fixup commits should be squashed before merge
- Reference issues: `Closes #XXXX` or `Ref #XXXX`
- Core team: all commits must be GPG signed
- External contributors: co-signature by core team member
- Always run linters and tests before commit.

**PR Standards:**
- Keep PRs small
- Include screenshots for visual changes
- **PR titles in French**, using persona format when applicable:
  - `ETQ admin, [description]` (En Tant Que admin)
  - `ETQ usager, [description]` (En Tant Que usager)
  - `ETQ instructeur, [description]`
  - `Tech: [description]` for purely technical changes
- **PR description**: Short summary with essential points for reviewers, avoid excessive technical detail

**Code Cleanliness:**
- Remove dead code and commented code
- Separate refactoring commits from feature commits
- Avoid dependency injection in constructors (directly mock dependencies in tests)

**Accessibility:**
- **Accessibility is a major requirement** for usager and instructeur interfaces
- Follow French accessibility standards (RGAA 4)
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes appropriately
- Test with keyboard navigation and screen readers when implementing UI changes

## Key Configuration

**Ruby version:** See `.ruby-version`
- Use `it` for simple one-line blocks: `ary.map { it.upcase }`
- Use hash value shorthand when key matches variable: `render locals: { user: }`

**Node/JavaScript:** Bun (package manager)
**Database:** PostgreSQL 17
**Job Queue:** Sidekiq (migrating from delayed_job)
**Caching:** Redis
**Locales:** French (default), English
**Time Zone:** Paris

**Environment:**
- `.env` - Local environment variables (copy from `config/env.example`)

**Maintenance Tasks:**
- Use the `MaintenanceTasks` gem for database operations, backfills, and data migrations
- Generate with `rails generate maintenance_tasks:task task_name`
- Tasks run in background and can be monitored via admin interface

## Security Considerations

- All code handles potentially sensitive government data
- ImageMagick policy must be restricted (see README)
- **Image Processing**: Uploaded images are processed based on their nature
  - Identity documents (`Champs::TitreIdentiteChamp`) receive watermarks for privacy protection
  - Different attachment types get appropriate representations (previews, thumbnails)
  - Processing logic in `BlobImageProcessorConcern`
- AGPL license - all code must be compatible
- Commits should be signed (GPG for core team)
- Brakeman security scanner runs in CI

## Testing Philosophy


- Use TDD as much as possible.
- Prefer system specs for user-facing features
- Use factories (FactoryBot) in `spec/factories/`
- Support files in `spec/support/`
- RSpec helper: `rails_helper.rb` (includes Rails), `spec_helper.rb` (no Rails)
- Don't over test; test suite execution must be fast.

## Notable Technical Details

- Uses `AASM` gem for state machines (Dossier states)
- Flipper for feature flags
- **Authorization**: Mostly handled directly in controllers; Pundit is used marginally
- Devise for authentication (with 2FA support)
- FranceConnect & ProConnect for government identity integration
- GraphQL::Batch for efficient GraphQL queries
- Discard gem for soft deletes
- Strong Migrations for database migration linting
- Skylight for performance monitoring
- Sentry for error tracking
- Prometheus metrics exported for Sidekiq (via Yabeda)
- langchainrb and anthropic gems for LLM integration
- `RetryableFetchError` for graceful external API degradation

## Support

User support is handled via **Crisp** integration.
