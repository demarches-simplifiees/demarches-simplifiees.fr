    # It is very important that we call #final because:
    #
    # 1. The authentication tag is checked during the call to #final
    # 2. Block based cipher modes (e.g. CBC) work on fixed size chunks. We need
    #    to call #final to get it to process the last chunk properly. The output
    #    of #final should be appended to the decrypted value. This isn't
    #    required for streaming cipher modes but including it is a best practice
    #    so that your code will continue to function correctly even if you later
    #    change to a block cipher mode.
