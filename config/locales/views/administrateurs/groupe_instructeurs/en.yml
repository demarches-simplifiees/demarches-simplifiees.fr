        notice_html: |
          Routing is a feature for procedures requiring the sharing of instructions between different groups according to a specific criterion (territory, theme or other).
          <br><br>
          This feature makes it possible to route the files to each group, and to no longer need to filter its files among a large quantity of requests. It is therefore particularly suitable for national approaches instructed locally.
          <br><br>
          Instructors only see the files that concern them, and therefore do not have access to data outside their scope.
          <br><br>
          Routing is activated once there are at least two active instructors   groups
