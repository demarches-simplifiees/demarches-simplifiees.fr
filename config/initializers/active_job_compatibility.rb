# The following jobs were renamed, but instances using the old name
# were still scheduled to run on the job queue.
#
# To ensure the job queue can instantiate these jobs using the previous
# names, this file defines retro-compatibility aliases.
#
# Once all jobs running using the previous name will have run, this
# file can be safely deleted.
#
# (That probably means a few hours after deploying the rename in production
# - but let's keep these for a while to make external integrators's life easier.
# To keep some margin, let's say this file can be safely deleted in May 2021.)
